\textbf{TODO: }
\textit{Here we should present the datasets, the data filtering and data splits, as well as the evaluation (i.e. sampling of k negatives and one positive) and the metrics we are using (i.e. Hit Ratio and NDCG). Also make a table with dataset characteristics. Also talk about the reformulation of the problems into the implicit feedback setting.}
