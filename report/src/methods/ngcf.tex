Tha main difference of NGCF from NCF are the embedding propagation layers which are 
designed to incorporate collaborative signal (especially high-order connectivities 
in users-items connections graph) into embeddings \ref{fig:ngcf}. Therefore, this is supposed to
improve the quality of recommendations.
