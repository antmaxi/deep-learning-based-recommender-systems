In this work, we experimentally study four recently proposed classes of deep learning based recommender systems, namely Neural Collaborative
Filtering, Collaborative Memory Networks, Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering, and Variational Autoencoders.
We focus on collaborative filtering for implicit feedback.
Our motivation is based on \cite{dacrema2019we} which states that there is a reproducibility crisis in the field of neural recommendation approaches.
Hence, in this work we try to contribute to the resolution of this crisis by objectively evaluating the performance of the selected methods.
In order to be able to compare the aforementioned approaches, we modified the authors' implementations so that they can work on the same train-test splits, and also use the same evaluation protocol and metrics.
We tuned these models and evaluated their performance on three real world datasets from different application domains.
Furthermore, we combined some of the architectures in an ensemble learning context, in an attempt to investigate if this can further boost the recommendation quality.
We present extensive comparative results along with discussions.
