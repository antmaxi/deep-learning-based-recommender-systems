\textbf{TODO: Finish abstract}
In this work, we conduct an empirical study of four recently proposed neural recommendation approaches, namely NCF \cite{he2017neural}, CMN \cite{ebesu2018collaborative}, NGCF \cite{wang2019neural}, and VAE \cite{liang2018variational}. Those engines can be used to solve collaborative filtering problems that rely on implicit feedback. The main motivation came from \cite{dacrema2019we} which states that there is a reproducibility crisis in the field of recommendation engines. To compare the aforementioned methods we adapted open source implementations to use equivalent metrics, preprocessing and train-test-splits on three different real-world datasets. Our results show that...
