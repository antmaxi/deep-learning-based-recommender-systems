\textbf{TODO: Finish abstract}
In this work, we experimentally study four recently proposed classes of deep learning based recommender systems, namely Neural Collaborative Filtering, Collaborative Memory Networks, Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering, and Variational Autoencoders, on the basis of collaborative filtering for implicit feedback.
Our motivation came from \cite{dacrema2019we} which states that there is a reproducibility crisis in the field of neural recommendation approaches.
Hence, in this work we try to contribute to the resolution of this crisis by objectively evaluating the performance of the selected methods.
In order to be able to compare the aforementioned approaches, we modified the authors' implementations so that they can work on the same train-test splits, and also use the same evaluation metrics.
Then, we tested the selected methods on three real world datasets.
Our results show that...
