%%% NGCF
NGCF show itself among other assessed methods as the best on the Jester dataset 
and as very good on the Movielens, but as the worst on the Epinions dataset.
It could be explained with differences in density of these datasets, because
Epinions is very sparse and, probably, it's hard for NGCF to incorporate 
collaborative signal into embeddings in these circumstances.
