% \textbf{TODO: }
% \textit{Here we will summarize our work. We conducted an objective experimental study of the methods in order to contribute to the resolution of the reproducibility crisis. What were our main conclusions? Furthermore, in order to be able to objectively compare the methods some modification/standarization of the authors' codes were needed. We need to briefly discuss these things.}
In our work, we tried to contribute to the resolution of the reproducibility crisis in the neural recommendation approaches. 
Through our experiments we've seen that all our methods except CMN produce comparable results to our baseline GMF on vastly different datasets. 
Moreover, combining some methods in an Ensemble seems to yield improved results, but more extensive research would be necessary to really investigate the interactions between the examined approaches.
