# Deep Learning based Recommender Systems.

In the data/ folder all the preprocessed data splits that we generated can be found, along with a README containing information about the datasets we used, the data preprocessing, and the data formatting.

In the methods/ folder, all the modified codes for the selected methods are given.
In every subfolder, a separate README can be found with the main modifications in each code as well as the instructions of how to use it.

The authors' original repositories that our codes were based on, can be found at:
- Neural Collaborative Filtering ( https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_collaborative_filtering ).
- Collaborative Memory Network ( https://github.com/tebesu/CollaborativeMemoryNetwork ).
- Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering ( https://github.com/xiangwang1223/neural_graph_collaborative_filtering ).
- Variational Autoencoder ( https://github.com/dawenl/vae_cf ).
